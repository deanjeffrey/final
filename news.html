        <h3><strong><em>Billy Joe Saunders Update</em></strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Billy Joe Saunders</strong> the former WBO Super Middleweight and Middleweight World Champion had to
            undergo surgery following his clash with Saul Canelo Alveres back on the 8th May 2021.<br>
            He had suffered <strong>multiple fractures to the orbital of his right eye.</strong></p>

        <p>Trainer <strong>Mark Tibbs</strong> has recently been recieving praise for pulling Billy from the fight as
            the Ninth round was about to start, most definitely saving Billy's career and most importantly his sight,
            leaving Billy Joe fans world wide anxiosly waiting for news on his return.<br> In a recent interview with
            <strong>Pro Beez</strong>
            for <strong>Pep Talk UK</strong> his trainer Mark Tibbs wasn't allowing himself to say to much and kept
            swerving any questions about Billy Joe saying that he had only been in contact via text messages since the
            fight and that he couldn't possibly speak for Billy at this time. Leaving fans wondering if Billy will ever
            return to the ring again.
        </p>

        <p>Billy Joe in True Billy Joe style has taken to social media dropping little hints and clue as to whether he
            will return, with many fans and insiders to the game confident of the former two weight Champion of the
            worlds return to the game. <br>
            After at times making possibly one of the all time pound for pound greats look average, he has surely
            cemented his place at the top with the elites of the game to be able to fight his way back into contention
            with a competetive comeback fight.</p>
